The recent schedule for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit + AI_dev China Conference was announced. The conference will be held in Hong Kong from August 21 to 23, 2024, featuring 145 sessions, including 20 maintainer-focused breakout sessions. At that time, cloud-native technology enthusiasts from all over Asia and around the world will gather in Hong Kong to share the latest technology trends, practical experiences, and innovative achievements, jointly promoting the development of cloud-native, open-source, and AI technologies.

In such a technological event, the fact that the topic of openGemini can stand out is undoubtedly an acknowledgment of its technical strength and innovative capabilities. The topic of openGemini was selected from hundreds of submissions through a rigorous screening process, which not only represents the professional level of the openGemini community but also indicates that its topic will bring profound insights and inspiration to the attendees.

Compared to previous editions, this conference has a separate "Data Processing + Storage" theme, highlighting the increasing challenges of efficient storage and management of data in the cloud-native technology ecosystem, with data storage and processing becoming increasingly key issues.

**Topic Introduction **：

Today, more and more car companies are building a new generation of Internet of Vehicles platforms based on cloud-native technology stacks such as Kubernetes. However, as more and more cars are produced, they generate hundreds of GB of data every second, making it difficult to store massive data in real-time and making storage costs difficult to control. which requires the platform’s underlying database to be low-cost, high-performance, and efficient. openGemini is a cloud-native distributed time series database with high performance and low cost. In data writing, we provide a dedicated high-performance data writing component that supports Arrow Flight. Regarding data storage, we provide specialized data compression algorithms and support local data storage and object storage. This talk will introduce how to build Internet of Vehicles platforms based on cloud-native technology stacks and share the technical practices on how to efficiently manage massive vehicle data.

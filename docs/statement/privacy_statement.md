1. How OpenGemini Collects Your Personal Data

Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, directly or indirectly, including information that can identify an individual when taken in combination with other information to which we have or are likely to have access.
We collect personal data from you in the course of your interaction with us or our Services, for various purposes, such as providing you (or the entity you represent or work for) with the Services and maintaining the best operation of the Services. Your interaction with us may include:

-   subscribing to the Services,
-   browsing our Website.

If you provide us with any personal data relating to a third party (e.g. information of your employees, officers, agents, representatives and/or end users), by submitting such information to us, you represent and warrant to us that you have notified such third party of the terms of this Statement and that you have an appropriate legal basis to disclose such data to us, including consent of the third party where appropriate, and we may further use such personal data as described in this Statement.

We generally do not require your personal data if you only browse the general content of the Community. We will collect your personal data accordingly in the following circumstances:

a) Mail Subscription. When you use our mail subscription service, we will collect your email address and name (optional). We will provide you with the email subscription service through this email address to facilitate your participation in discussions in the Community.

b) Service Optimization. For the purpose of operating the Community and providing better services, we will deploy a trusted third-party plugin to collect information from your browser, computer, and mobile device, including but not limited to your IP address, access source, number of visits to the Community, stay duration, access timestamp, browser type, and server type and version, etc. We do this to help us improve the overall accuracy of information and better tailor our interactions with you.

Many of the Services require personal data to operate. If you choose not to provide the data required, you may not be able to use those Services. For example, if you do not subscribe to mail on our Website by submitting your personal data, you cannot be able to participate in the discussions in the community. In other cases, where providing personal data is optional, and you choose not to submit your personal data, you may be unable to use certain features of the Services, such as personalization. However, this will not affect your use of other features of the Services.

3. How OpenGemini Uses Cookie and Similar Technologies

a) To ensure our website works properly, we may at times place cookies on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small data file placed on your computer or mobile device used to access a website. The content of a cookie can be retrieved or read only by the server that creates the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for understanding how you interact with our websites, helping you efficiently browse pages, storing and honoring your preferences, improving your browsing experience, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes.

b) We categorize cookies on our websites into one category:

​ Statistical analysis cookies: We collect information about your use of our services, including your single or multiple visits, which help us understand how you interact with the services. We use the statistical analysis plugin provided by Baidu.

Many services require cookies. If you do not allow cookies related to these services, you may not be able to use these services or specific functions of these services.

c) Do Not Track. Many Web browsers provide the Do Not Track function, which sends Do Not Track requests to websites. Currently, major Internet standardization organizations have not established policies to specify how websites should handle these requests. If you enable Do Not Track or similar functions that your browser may provide, we will not change the way your data is collected and used as described in this Statement. However, we reserve the right to respond to your Do Not Track request and stop collecting your data without prior notice.

d) Your Choice. Most browsers allow you to delete or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in the browser settings. By default, many browsers accept cookies until you change your settings.

4. How OpenGemini Shares Your Personal Data

Sharing means providing third parties with personal data, where such third parties would handle the personal data independently of us or on our behalf.

Our partners may include:

1\) Third-party providers, developers, platforms and social media networks, and business partners. Some Services may be provided directly by third-party providers, developers or platforms. In such cases, we need to provide them with the relevant transaction information. For example, if you purchase third parties’ service via Marketplace, we need to share your personal data with them to fulfil the transaction. If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network (such as by logging in to the Website using your account with the third-party, providing your access token for the Services to a third-party, or otherwise linking your account to a third-party’s services), we may disclose the personal data that you authorized us to share for this purpose. If you connect your account with the business partners’ account, we need to disclose the necessary information to them in order to facilitate the Service. We do not control the third party’s use of your personal data.

2\) Service providers and professional advisors. We may share your personal data with third party companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Website and the Services (such as supply, infrastructure, hosting, customer support, payment, analytics, delivery, marketing, and database management services). We share such data only for purposes consistent with this Statement or under your authorization. For example, we need to share your order information with logistic service providers in order to arrange delivery, and we need to share your financial information with payment service providers in order to confirm and proceed with your payment instructions. We may disclose your personal data to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

When we share your personal data with third parties, their responsibilities and obligations will be governed by contracts and we will require them to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the personal data processed.

5. How OpenGemini Protects Your Personal Data

We take the security of your personal data seriously. We take appropriate physical, organizational, and technical measures to protect your personal data. For example, we use encryption to ensure data confidentiality; we use trusted protection mechanisms to prevent malicious data attacks; we deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access your personal data; and we raise awareness among employees about the importance of protecting personal data through security and privacy protection training sessions. To this end, we take the following measures: \
a) We take reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that the personal data collected is minimal and relevant to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. \
b) We use a range of technologies such as cryptographic technologies to ensure the confidentiality of data in transmission. We implement trusted protection mechanisms to protect data and data storage servers from attacks. \
c) We deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access your personal data. In addition, we control the number of authorized personnel and implement hierarchical permission management on them based on service requirements and personnel levels. \
d) We strictly select business partners and service providers and incorporate personal data protection requirements into commercial contracts, audits, and appraisal activities. \
e) We hold security and privacy protection training courses, tests, and publicity activities to raise employees' personal data protection awareness.

To cope with possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, openGemini has developed several mechanisms and control measures, clearly defined the rating standards of security incidents and vulnerabilities and corresponding processing procedures.

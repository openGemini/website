On July 9, 2024, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) officially accepted the cloud-native high-performance time-series database project [openGemini](https://github.com/openGemini). The addition of openGemini has greatly enriched the exploration, innovation, and development of cloud-native database technology.

openGemini's commercial product is Huawei Cloud's GeminiDB database, aiming to solve the storage and analysis technical challenges of massive observable data.



The goal of openGemini is to build a comprehensive, stable, flexible, and thriving platform for processing observability data. This platform will serve key industries such as electricity, energy, IoV, IoT, DevOps, and aerospace, supporting the storage and in-depth analysis of various data types such as metrics, logs, and traces.



In the future, openGemini will also achieve deeper integration with top CNCF projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, KubeEdge, and openTelemetry to jointly promote the development of cloud-native observability and edge computing technologies, and bring more efficient and intelligent data processing solutions to the industry.

Since open source in 2022, openGemini has received widespread attention and support from the developers. The community has 22 sub-projects, 1K GitHub Stars, and more than 140 Forks, and has attracted over 100 developers from companies and universities. openGemini is promoting the continuous development of open-source observability database technology.



**Huawei Cloud CTO Yuxin Zhang** said, "For IoT and large-scale operation and maintenance scenarios, the integrated solution of time-series database storage and analysis has great advantages. openGemini has shown excellent performance in metric data management and multi-dimensional aggregation. Huawei Cloud will open-source its self-used projects, hoping to work with enterprises and developers to jointly promote the technological innovation of time-series databases and build an open technical ecosystem"



**Huawei Cloud's General Manager of Open Source Business Mingkun Deng** said, "The openGemini project is a key part of Huawei Cloud's open source strategy for its full-stack cloud-native technology. This donation brings a competitive time-series database into the cloud-native community, promoting the prosperity and development of the cloud-native ecosystem. At the same time, the support and resources of CNCF will also accelerate the innovation and development of openGemini in the field of cloud-native, thereby better providing high-quality time series database products and solutions to global organizations and developers."



**CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) member Kevin Wang** commented, "Observability is an important part of the cloud-native ecosystem. openGemini provides a powerful ability for data storage, analysis, compression, and cluster expansion for observability scenarios, which can help users efficiently analyze and process large-scale observability data and reduce storage costs. openGemini has brought new vitality to the community, and we look forward to its greater role in the cloud-native ecosystem."



At present, the project has been tested and applied in more than 60 enterprises and units such as **Huawei Cloud**, **Xinwang Technology**, **China Communications Information Technology**, and **Quectel**, promoting industrial development with open-source innovation. The technical advantages of openGemini have also been highly recognized by enterprise users.



"The Qian Yun Logistics GPS platform finally chose openGemini to store truck driving data after an In-depth technical comparison. With its high performance, flexible distributed architecture, and integrated data analysis capabilities, openGemini provides stable and efficient services to the 30,000 corporate users and 1.7 million drivers on our platform, demonstrating its huge potential in the enterprise bulk logistics industry. We believe that the openGemini project joining CNCF will bring intelligent data management and decision-making support to more companies, leading intelligent companies to new heights."

“The CCCC BIM Center relies on high-performance and high-availability database solutions to handle massive of device data. In the process of developing business systems based on openGemini, its powerful time series data storage capabilities and efficient query performance have helped us achieve significant breakthroughs in device data analysis and real-time insights. Moreover, openGemini is also easy to use and very stable, greatly improving development efficiency and system reliability. We recommend openGemini to all companies that need to process large-scale data. It will be a powerful database for you to maximize the value of your data.”

> Yanan Li, the chief engineer of the China Communications BIM Center



"The key business scenarios of the industrial IoT platform, such as production process visualization, quality process analysis & backtracking, production energy consumption optimization, and equipment preventive maintenance, involve the collection and use of massive time series data. Traditional relational databases are completely unable to support such a large amount of data. After comparing time series databases, we chose to store all the data in openGemini. openGemini helps the IoT platform achieve: massive data concurrent writing, highly compressed data, and low-latency aggregate query. I hope that openGemini can continue to develop explosively, and we will continue to work closely with the openGemini community to enhance the competitiveness of openGemini in industrial scenarios."

> Min Huang, Huawei Cloud Industrial IoT Platform Chief Architect



"As a rising star in time-series databases, openGemini has many features that make it the best choice for Quectel‘s AIOT platform. High-performance read and write and high data compression rate greatly reduce data storage costs, and adaptation to the InfluxDB line protocol reduces the learning cost for developers. The openGemini community atmosphere is very friendly and responds fastly. We look forward to cooperating with the openGemini community to jointly promote the development of time-series database technology."

>  Yang Jiao，Quectel AIOT Platform Architect"



## Looking to the future

The official acceptance of openGemini by CNCF as a sandbox project will greatly promote the construction and cooperation of the openGemini upstream and downstream technology ecosystem. openGemini will join hands with more partners to continue to make efforts in resource integration, project cooperation, talent training, and ecological building, to promote the development of the community and achieve the dual growth of individuals and organizations. 

Join us to create a more prosperous and vibrant technical community.

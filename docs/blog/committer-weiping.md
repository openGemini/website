September saw the arrival of a heavyweight Committer in our community, Wang Weiping, who has been honored twice as one of Huawei Cloud's top ten Committers. Next, we will share his story of growth and journey in the openGemini community.

## Self-Introduction

My name is Wang Weiping, and I serve as a Senior R&D Engineer in the IoT department at Huawei Cloud. I graduated from Huazhong University, focusing on Java technology, and I have seven years of development experience.

I have always used open-source projects, keen on studying their source code to learn from their excellent designs and coding practices. I have applied some outstanding examples to my daily coding work, steadily improving my coding skills. So, at this stage, although I have not participated in the open-source community, I have benefited from it for a long time.

## Transition from Observer to Participant: The Call of openGemini

As my exploration of open-source projects deepened, I gradually shifted from being a mere learner to a discoverer and solver of issues. When I first submitted an issue to an open-source community and quickly received responses and enthusiastic discussions from many contributors, the spirit of collaboration and sharing touched me. I realized that participating in open-source is not just about technological exchange; it's also an opportunity to connect with experts, learn, and grow. This realization prompted me to join the open-source journey of openGemini.

Data processing and analysis are among the core challenges in the Internet of Things. openGemini, known for its excellent read-write performance and efficient data analysis capabilities as a time-series database, has become the ideal choice for our team to solve this problem. With the rapid development of openGemini's SDK, I joined the openGemini open-source community, hoping to contribute my coding experience to create a more complete, user-friendly, and powerful client SDK together.

## Deepening openGemini Java SDK

In the openGemini community, the Java SDK already has core functionalities and supports multiple HttpClient implementations to meet the needs of different scenarios. Whether it's the Java native HttpClient with minimal dependencies, the Android scenario integrated with okhttp, or the implementation based on asynchttpclient and reactor, the openGemini Java SDK provides a unified designed interface. The openGemini SDK supports various programming languages, and each language SDK follows a unified design with the highest compatibility with openGemini, making it the preferred choice for accessing the openGemini database.

I focus on developing and optimizing the Java SDK, especially its integration with the SpringBoot framework. Integrating openGemini Client with SpringBoot will significantly simplify the SDK usage process. Through annotations and OpenGeminiTemplate, data can be read and written more conveniently, and it supports the automatic creation of Database and RetentionPolicy corresponding to annotated POJO classes. At the same time, I actively participate in reviewing and improving SDKs in other programming languages to ensure the consistency and ease of use of interfaces in various programming languages. In the openGemini community, we have monthly exchange meetings and active contributor groups. This is a platform for technical exchange and conveys a persistent pursuit of excellent coding practices.

## Looking to the Future: Building a Technological Future with Unwavering Passion

I asked a senior developer with nearly twenty years of experience if he still loves coding. As I asked this question, I suddenly realized that I was actually asking myself, and at that moment, I already had an answer for myself. I look forward to continuing to shine in the openGemini open-source community in the days to come, working with like-minded partners to build an exciting technological future with unwavering passion and effort. Finally, thank the community for accepting me as a Committer and the proactive and responsive friends.
